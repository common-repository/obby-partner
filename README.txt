== Description ==

Thanks for using our Obby Partner plugin. This little tool will make everyones life so much easier - you won’t ever have to inform Obby of new classes or dates again, and Obby won’t have to nag you about them :)

Just some of the boring stuff so you know exactly what the plugin does and does not do:

- This plugin allows Obby to collect data on the stock levels of your classes so that our systems can update and reflect what you have live on your site. This means that we collect all your class and stock level data.
- We do not under any circumstance at all collect any customer data (i.e. we do not see the name, contact or payment details of any of your customers). That is a slippery can of worms we just don’t want to touch!
- This plugin is read-only. Meaning that we can only see stuff, we in no way have the ability to update anything on your systems ourselves.
- This plugin can be disabled at any time just by going into the plugin page in your WordPress administration.

Thanks for helping us make the Obby platform better and being part of the journey!
